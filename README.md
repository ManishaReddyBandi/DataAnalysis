The Airbnb Pricing Data Analysis project, we're digging into what makes rental prices go up or down on Airbnb. We're looking at things like where the place is, what kind of home it is, the price it costs, and when it's available. By playing around with the data, we hope to find some patterns and use fancy computer models to predict how much hosts should charge. This isn't just about numbers â€“ it's about helping hosts make more money and helping guests find good deals. It's like giving hosts a secret weapon to make their Airbnb game strong.
